/*phi(n) is known as totient function and is equal to the no of numbers thjat are less than n and are relatively prime to n.
Two integers are relatively prime (or coprime) if there is no integer greater than one that divides them both (that is, their 
greatest common divisor is one). For example, 12 and 13 are relatively prime, but 12 and 14 are not.*/
